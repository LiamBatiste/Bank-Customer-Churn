# Project Summary
## Introduction
A Bank has outsourced an already cleansed dataset, in hope that actionable insights can be gained to reduce customer churn within their company, particularly among credit card holders. By analysing the uncovered most influential factors of custoemr churn through Data
Exploration and Predictive Modelling these insights can be leveraged to lower rates of customer churn for the Bank.

The dataset provided for this Analysis has been taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset. This dataset cotains the following fields: 

- customer_id, unused variable.
- credit_score, used as input.
- country, used as input.
- gender, used as input.
- age, used as input.
- tenure, used as input.
- balance, used as input.
- products_number, used as input.
- credit_card, used as input.
- active_member, used as input.
- estimated_salary, used as input.
- churn, used as the target. 1 if the client has left the bank during some period or 0 if he/she has not.

# Data Exploration
Overview
Provide an overview of the dataset, including its size, features, and target variable (churn).

## Key Findings
Summarize the key insights gained during data exploration, such as distributions of variables, correlations, and initial observations.

## Insights for Action
Highlight actionable insights derived from the data exploration phase, focusing on factors influencing churn and potential strategies for retention.

# Predictive Modeling
Approach
Describe the modeling approach taken, including the types of models tested (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, random forest), and preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, feature engineering).

## Model Performance
Discuss the performance of each model tested, including accuracy metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and any challenges encountered.

## Refinement
Explain how the model was refined using techniques like GridSearchCV or hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Best Model
Detail the best-performing model selected based on evaluation metrics, such as test accuracy and other relevant metrics.

# Actionable Recommendations
Summarize the actionable recommendations derived from the predictive modeling results, emphasizing strategies to reduce customer churn based on the insights gained.

# Conclusion
Wrap up with a brief conclusion highlighting the main findings, the impact of the best model, and potential next steps for further improvement or application.

# Appendix
Include any additional details, code snippets, or visualizations that support your findings but weren't included in the main sections.
